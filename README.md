# Predicting no-show appointments in Brazil (Kaggle challenge)

This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. 

- ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.
- ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.
- ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.
